## Synopsis

This program implements Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm for undirected graphs using a disjoint set data structure. It processes a file containing a description of a graph. A graph description contains an arbitrary number of edge discriptions. An edge description consists of two vertices (optionally followed by a weight) followed by a semicolon. All tokens are separated by whitespace. A vertex is a non-negative integer. If a weight is omitted, a weight of 1 is assumed. Weights are all positive integers.

## Compilation

Simply running the makefile should work fine.
